_CAKE SHOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM_
=
********************************************************

Objectives of the Project :
-----------------------------------------------------------
To make ordering and management very friendly to both Customer as well as the Shopkeeper.


Data Structure Used :
------------------------------------------------------------
In our project we have used Doubly Linked List to store information of cakes available in the Cake Shop as well as to store Customer's Orders.In the cakes' shop, shopkeeper can daily update the available cakes' list (delete particular cake or to insert new cake details).As Doubly Linked List provides efficient insertion and deletion at any position we use it as our main data structure.

Functionalities :
-----------------------------------------------------------
In our Project there are two modes :
1. Admin Mode :
         Admin can view today's orders, also he can add new variety of cakes, delete cakes from menu as daily availability of cakes may change.
2. Customer Mode :
         Customer can view the available cakes' list. Also he can place his order and can delete particular cake from the ordered cakes.
      
#### Application is built using Java, for GUI we have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and for database MySQL.
We now feel more confident using this Data Structure.
 
Whatâ€™s next for the project :
---------------------------------------------------------
We can add many things like to keep track of stock of ingredients, also can offer home delivery service to customer.We can allow customer to customize the cakes, provide gifts and other bakery products.
